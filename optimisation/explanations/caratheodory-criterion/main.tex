\section{Introduction}
   In measure theory, after defining the \textbf{outer measure}(denoted as $\lambda^*$) we need to
   define sets that are measurable as not all the sets are measurable, for
   instance \textit{Vitali set}. Hence,
\begin{definition}
Let $\Omega$ be a space and with $E \subset \Omega$. $E$ is  \textbf{measurable} if and only if for all subset of $\Omega$ denoted as $A$, not necessarily measurable
\[
\lambda^*(A) = \lambda^*(A \cap E) + \lambda^*(A \cap E^c)
\] 
\end{definition}
An interesting fact about $A$ is that it may be (and usually is)
non-measurable. But why does it work in the first place even for
\textit{non-measurable} $A$? Let's start with a reminder what an outer measure and its intuition is.

\section{Outer measure}%
\label{sec:Outer measure}
\begin{definition}
    An outer measure is a map denoted as $\lambda^*: \Omega \to \R^+$ that satisfies the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\lambda^*(\emptyset) = 0$
        \item $A \subset B \subset \Omega \implies \lambda^*(A) < \lambda^*(B)$ 
        \item $\lambda^*(\cup A_n) \le \sum_n \lambda^*(A_n)$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}\label{defn:lebesgue-outer-measure}
    The Lebesgue outer measure of a set $E \subset R^n$ is 
    \[
        \lambda^*(E) = inf \left\{ \cup_{i \in I} V_i \right\}
    \] 
    with $(V_i)_{i \in I}$ a family of boxes such that $E \subset \cup_{i_I} V_i$.
\end{definition}

Intuitively, we look for the smallest set of measurable sets (boxes) that cover
$E$.  

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \incfig{cover-example2}
    \caption{Searching for infinum of covers of $E$. \
        The black space is our
        set $E$, blue rectangles are the boxes of the  $(V_i)_{i \in I}$
        family. \
        On the right, the rectangles are smaller lead to less amount of white spaces taking into account.}
    \label{fig:cover-example2}
\end{figure}

That is the intuitive way of the \textit{Lebesgue Outer Measure} (see the
definition ~\ref{defn:lebesgue-outer-measure}). We look for smaller boxes and
better placements to cover over set $E$ in order to find the smallest size of
such cover.

In the rest of this explanation we suppose that the blue box on the right of
the Figure \ref{fig:cover-example2} is the smallest box we can take to cover any set
to calculate the outer measure.

Before moving on, let's see an example of non-measurable set (in our simplified
sense) and measurable set (in the same sense):
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \incfig{non-measurable-and-measurable}
    \caption{The set on the left is non measurable because it is not "pretty
    enough" to cover it with boxes. However, the one on the right is covered
with the boxes ideally without any white space.}

\end{figure}
