    \item 
        The "Non-Measurable" Drawings Are Just Analogies: This is the most significant
        simplification. The "unpretty" black blob shown in the figures (e.g., Figure \ref{fig:a-and-unpretty-e})
        is, technically, a Lebesgue measurable set.  Truly non-measurable sets, like
        the Vitali set, are so pathologically complex that they cannot be drawn. They
        are composed of a completely disconnected "dust" of points. The drawing is a
        metaphor for the extreme boundary complexity that causes the Carathéodory
        criterion to fail.
    \item 
        The Covering Process: The presented process of "covering" oversimplifies the
        idea of real covering and the measure, that of an outer measure by
        imagining a single grid of "the smallest box". In reality, the definition of
        outer measure involves finding the infimum—the greatest lower bound—of the sum
        of volumes of all possible countable collections of boxes that cover the set,
        with boxes of any size and position. The core idea of covering presented here
        efficiency still holds true under this precise definition.
