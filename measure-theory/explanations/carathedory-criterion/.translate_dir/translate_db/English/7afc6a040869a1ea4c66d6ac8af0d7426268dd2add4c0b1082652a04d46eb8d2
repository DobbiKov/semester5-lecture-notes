If $E$ is measurable, then for our chosen  $A$, we must have
 \[
\lambda^*(A) = \lambda^*(A \cap E) + \lambda^*(A \cap E^c)
\] 

That is to say, that if we split $A$ on the parts of  $E$ and its complement, the sum of the measures of the splitted parts equals to the measure of $A$, let's take a look on the split of $A$:
