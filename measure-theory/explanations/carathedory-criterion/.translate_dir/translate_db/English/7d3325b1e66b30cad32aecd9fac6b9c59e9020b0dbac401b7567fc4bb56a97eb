That is the intuitive way of the \textit{Lebesgue Outer Measure} (see the
definition ~\ref{defn:lebesgue-outer-measure}). We look for smaller boxes and
better placements to cover over set $E$ in order to find the smallest size of
such cover.

In the rest of this explanation we suppose that the blue box on the right of
the Figure \ref{fig:cover-example2} is the smallest box we can take to cover any set
to calculate the outer measure.
